## Question (Kpis)

-What does the KPI “Selected Students = 1318” represent, and how is it calculated in your dashboard?
-How does the ‘30+ Units in Year 1’ KPI help measure student academic performance or progress?
-What insight can you draw from the fact that only 21.62% of students completed more than 30 units in their first year?
-Why is tracking student count by year important for institutional performance measurement?
-How do the KPIs for awards (A.A., A.S., Certificates) reflect student success trends?
-What does the transfer institute KPI reveal about student continuation rates and preferred universities?
-How do you define success metrics in this dashboard — what KPIs show improvement or decline?
-If the number of selected students decreases next year, which other KPIs would you analyze to find the reason?
-What thresholds or goals would you set for these KPIs to evaluate academic progress over time?
-How could you automate or refresh KPI values when new data is added to the source file?
